# Grant proposal

There will be only **one winning proposal** in each voting period based on results of voting by Elastos community.

**Voting Score** is calculated:

{% hint style="info" %}
_upvote count - downvote count_
{% endhint %}



The minimum **Voting Score** for funds to be granted to a winning proposal is **50**.

* If the Voting Score of winning proposal is **more than required minimum**, the E-Lab admin will manually grant funds to a winning proposal. Funds will be released based on milestones in CR suggestion by _Cyber Republic multisignature wallet_.
* If the Voting Score of winning proposal is **less than required minimum**, no funds will be granted in that voting period. In following voting period, there can be **2 winning proposal**, if they both obtain required minimum Voting Score.
