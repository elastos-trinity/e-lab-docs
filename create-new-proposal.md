3. Send new message in [üåê Projects / ùêÑ‚îÉe-lab](https://discord.gg/pnwm6equkt) channel on Official Elastos server about your new proposal and mention **@Guardians** role
4. Guardians review **E-Lab proposal** and **CR suggestion**
5. Guardians will:
   * ask proposer to adjust CR suggestion if needed
   * deny the proposal if:&#x20;
     * doesn‚Äôt contain necessary information&#x20;
     * doesn‚Äôt comply with E-Lab [rules.md](introduction/rules.md "mention")
6. Once proposer and Guardians agree on the final proposal and suggestion wording, the proposer **must sign CR suggestion** so it can not be altered in the future.&#x20;
7. Guardians will **approve E-Lab proposal**&#x20;
8. The proposal will appear in Community Proposal tab on e-lab and will be waiting for next voting period.
